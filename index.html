                    <h2>Zulfiqar Sword(7th century, Middle East)</h2> 
                    <p>The Zulfiqar sword was a scimitar given to Ali ibn Abi Talib by the Prophet Muhammad, according to Shi’ite tradition. Talib was the son-in-law of Muhammad and Caliph from 656 to 661. 

                        Like other scimitars, Zulfiqar would have had a curved blade of medium size. The sword is a symbol of the Islamic faith and featured on flags of the Ottoman Empire. It was also a symbol of the Janissaries, who were the standing army of the Ottoman Empire. 
                        
                        When depicted on flags and in artwork, Zulfiqar has a scissor-like blade instead of a single blade.</p>

                    <h2>Sword of Goujian(Spring & Autumn Period, China)</h2> 
                    <p>The sword of Goujian was created during the Spring and Autumn period of ancient Chinese history, between 771 and 476 BC. The sword was made for Emperor Goujian and is today known as the “Oriental Excalibur.” 

                        This weapon is significant because of its near-perfect condition upon excavation. In 1965, a team of archaeologists uncovered the sword of Goujian. Although it dated over 2,000 years old, the sword was untarnished and retained its original sharpness. </p>

                    <h2>Tizona Sword (11th century, Spain)</h2> 
                    <p>The Tizona sword was forged around 1002 and belonged to the legendary Castilian noble and fighter El Cid. He wielded Tizona in many battles against the Moors. The sword saw so much battle that it featured in the Song of El Cid, a medieval poem telling of his many exploits. 

                        Because of its rich history as the sword of El Cid, Tizona remains one of Spain’s most valuable national treasures. </p>
